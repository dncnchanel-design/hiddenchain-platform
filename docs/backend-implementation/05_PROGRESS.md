# Progress Ledger

## Current checkpoint — 2026-08-20

### Completed

- Read and applied `AGENTS.md`, five repository Skills, the formal task directive, and the complete design document.
- Resolved and verified `PROJECT_ROOT`.
- Audited Git, repository structure, frontend, backend, tests, data-space code, deployment manifests, and host tool availability without writes.
- Recorded architecture decisions, capability truth labels, implementation plan and workstream ownership.
- Implemented versioned migrations with checksum verification and truth-preserving `LEGACY_UNMIGRATED` projection.
- Implemented Data Asset/Passport/Quality and policy-version persistence while retaining existing upload compatibility.
- Implemented TTC Attempts, hashed transitions, abnormal paths, Rule Freeze and immutable execution snapshots.
- Implemented controlled Agent Tool catalog, explicit grants, authorization checks and Tool-call audit records.
- Implemented A/B/C evidence classification, domain-separated Merkle batches and transactional Outbox processing with retry and dead letter.
- Implemented additive secret-sharing integer sum as `LOCAL_REAL_EXPERIMENTAL_SINGLE_HOST`.
- Added `0.2.0` version, liveness, dependency-aware readiness and structured API error/optimistic concurrency/idempotency contracts.
- Integrated authoritative backend state into the frontend data path without redesigning the frozen visual system.
- Updated trusted-execution, production-readiness, deployment and backend-implementation documentation to match the code boundary.
- Closed independent review blockers for state-machine artifact gates, organization/DID authorization, audit approval, algorithm/build binding, Vault input integrity, Merkle batch replay verification and anchor receipt validation.
- Passed 117 backend tests, 79% fixed-seed backend branch coverage, 46 frontend tests, explicit golden paths, OpenAPI serialization, production/brand guards, Python/TypeScript compilation, ESLint and Vite production build.
- Completed final cached-diff, protected-asset boundary and high-confidence secret scans, then created implementation commit `71de395bf658fa34c8d271705ace130d9abf0e24`.
- Reconciled the newly observed remote commits with a no-conflict non-fast-forward merge `562f762`; post-merge golden paths passed.

### Current release state

- `READY_FOR_GITHUB_PUSH_AFTER_SAFE_MERGE`. The remote ref was fetched with authorized elevated access, the two equivalent remote commits were merged without conflicts, and the merged candidate is ready for a non-force push.

### Pending release evidence

- GitHub push, remote SHA verification, Render review/test deployment, online health/smoke and deployed SHA verification.
- Local Docker image build and real PostgreSQL migration/concurrency validation remain unavailable on this host.

### Known blockers

- Eclipse EDC remains `ADAPTER`; TEE and cross-domain production MPC remain `BLOCKED`; blockchain consensus remains `DEMO` only.
- PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Milvus and production high-availability infrastructure are unavailable or unverified.
- The available Render manifest is review/test only and cannot satisfy production acceptance.
- Normal sandbox egress remains unavailable, but authorized elevated Git access succeeded for fetch; push still must be verified before Render can be attempted.

### Next step

- Push the merged candidate non-force, verify the remote SHA, then continue the Render review/test sequence without calling it “production.”
